# Vision Protector
According to the 20-20-20 rule, I should take a rest for 20 seconds after using the computer for 20 minutes. This project reminds me to take a break every 20 minutes. This project will eventually be combined into my application collections on [heroku](https://duos-personal-apps.herokuapp.com/).

## Install
To install, download the files and install the nodejs packages using
```
npm install
```
Then start the server on http://localhost:3000 with
```
npm start
```
